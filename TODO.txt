- INVESTIGATE
    - Taxi situation with the flight master's whistle
    - RotateDegrees causing continous rotate when the rotate back is canceled
    - Restore views might be broken with nameplate fit
    - Save/Restore zoom level for fit isn't working properly
- SOON
    - Change to stack-based system for restoration
    - Holy shit, there are tristate toggles, use them!
    - Zoom in/out by increments
    - Find new ways to cheat zoom fit
    - "Short Term" Situations that won't exit previous situation
    - 'Camera Settings' should allow for not adjusting target lock or dynamic pitch at all
    - Close all panels interface action
    - Under advanced mode, you should be able to add/delete situations
    - Shoulder offset should have an indication of what shoulder it's over instead of negative positive
    - Look into just setting the shoulder offset at a default cvar and taking it out of the default situations
- SOONISH
    - Change Camera follow settings
    - Zoom to fit, update when target change, without continous
    - Zoom to fit nameplates should be able to specify where the nameplate should be and how sensitive that it should be
    - Zoom to fit nameplates should not continue to try to zoom if the nameplate isn't moving
    - Adjust shoulder offset in steps over some time, to avoid abrupt movements
    - There should be several sets of defaults, with ranged classes getting one set (and a profile) and melee classes getting another (and a profile)
    - Better combat detection
        - only assume that we're in combat when the player has taken a direct offensive action
        - how should this work with charge skills?
- DOWN THE LINE
    - Keybinds
        - Zoom in/out quickly (ideal bind shift-mousewheel)
        - Zoom fit keybind
        - etc.
    - Faux camera shake should be possible
    - Move to event-based with situations specifying which events, polling as an option still though
    - Easing for camera actions
    - Slash commands for temp situations or to force an existing situation
    - Should be using a syntax highlighter for lua code editing in-game, but that's a ways off
    - 'Interface Actions' should allow for hiding arbitary frames while under advanced mode
    - Weak Aura's support
        - be able to trigger a camera transition from a weak aura
    - Under advanced mode, you should be able to edit the lua functions (init, onEnter, onExit) that aren't being used right now
    - Lua env for all lua code executed by condition, init, onEnter, onExit
        - use a whitelist, with constant functions so nothing "bad" can happen
    - WeakAura's style import/export for situations, entire group of situations
