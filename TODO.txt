    - ?

- VERSION 13
    - Change database structure
    - Move to event-based with situations specifying which events, polling as an option still though
    - Clean-up settings menu
        - localize
        - make changing a setting in the current situation instantly change the current settings
    - Change ALL camera settings
    - 'Camera Settings' should allow for not adjusting target lock
    - Remove hide frame feature -- just make it work with hiding the entire UI, anything more is out of scope
    - default changes:
        - Shoulder offset as a default cvar and taking it out of the default situations

- PLANNED BEFORE BETA (@PRE-PATCH CURSE RELEASE)
    - There should be several sets of defaults
        - ranged classes getting one set (and a profile) and melee classes getting another (and a profile)
    - Change to stack-based system
        - enables "short-term" situations that won't exit previous situation
        - restore would be stack-based as well
        - How to handle stack where middle falls out
            - 1 > 2 > 3, 2 becomes not active but 3 still is
    - Implement Advanced Mode fully
        - if a situation has advanced options, need to notify outside of advanced mode
        - add/delete situations
        - lua functions init, onEnter, onExit
        - export/import situations/groups of situations "WeakAura-Style"
    - Slash commands
        - for temp situations/camera actions
        - lock/unlock situations changing

- PLANNED BEFORE FULL RELEASE (@LEGION FULL RELEASE)
    - Lua env for all lua code executed by condition, init, onEnter, onExit
        - use a whitelist, with constant functions so nothing "bad" can happen
    - Keybinds
        - Zoom in/out quickly (ideal bind shift-mousewheel)
        - Zoom fit keybind
        - etc.

- MAYBE
    - Close all panels interface action
    - Save/Restore NPC/Model zoom level
    - Easing for camera actions
    - Faux camera shake should be possible
    - Find new ways to cheat zoom fit
        - model-based zoom fit?
    - Adjust shoulder offset in steps over some time, to avoid abrupt movements
    - Better combat detection
        - only assume that we're in combat when the player has taken a direct offensive action
        - how should this work with charge skills?

- DOWN THE LINE
    - Zoom-to-fit improvements
        - should not continue to try to zoom if the nameplate isn't moving
        - update when target changes, without continous
        - allow continous to be canceled by manual zooming
    - lua syntax highlighter for lua code editing in-game
    - Weak Aura's support
        - be able to trigger a camera transition from a weak aura
