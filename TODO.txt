- INVESTIGATE
    - Taxi situation with the flight master's whistle
    - RotateDegrees causing continous rotate when the rotate back is canceled
    - Restore views might be broken with nameplate fit
    - Save/Restore zoom level for fit isn't working properly
    - Hidden secure frames, nameplates need to be shown/hidden during combat lockdown grace period

- PLANNED SOON
    - Reimplement Save/Restore zoom level
    - Change Camera follow settings
    - Close all panels interface action
    - 'Camera Settings' should allow for not adjusting target lock
    - Shoulder offset as a default cvar and taking it out of the default situations
    - Modify CameraZoomIn/Out to take second param so that we can 'mark' automatic changes vs. manual ones
        - Zoom to fit, allow continous to be canceled by manual zooming
    - Zoom to fit, update when target changes, without continous
    - Zoom to fit nameplates should not continue to try to zoom if the nameplate isn't moving

- PLANNED BEFORE BETA (@PRE-PATCH CURSE RELEASE)
    - Change database structure
        - upgrade old structure
    - There should be several sets of defaults
        - ranged classes getting one set (and a profile) and melee classes getting another (and a profile)
    - Clean-up settings menu
        - localize
        - make changing a setting in the current situation instantly change the current settings
    - Move to event-based with situations specifying which events, polling as an option still though
    - Change to stack-based system
        - enables "short-term" situations that won't exit previous situation
        - restore would be stack-based as well
        - Zoom in/out by increments
        - How to handle stack where middle falls out
            - 1 > 2 > 3, 2 becomes not active but 3 still is
    - Implement Advanced Mode fully
        - add/delete situations
        - lua functions init, onEnter, onExit
        - Hide arbitary frames
    - Export/Import situations/groups of situations "WeakAura-Style"
    - Keybinds
        - Zoom in/out quickly (ideal bind shift-mousewheel)
        - Zoom fit keybind
        - etc.
    - Slash commands for temp situations or to force an existing situation

- PLANNED BEFORE FULL RELEASE (@LEGION FULL RELEASE)
    - Lua env for all lua code executed by condition, init, onEnter, onExit
        - use a whitelist, with constant functions so nothing "bad" can happen

- MAYBE
    - Easing for camera actions
    - Faux camera shake should be possible
    - Find new ways to cheat zoom fit
        - model-based zoom fit?
    - Adjust shoulder offset in steps over some time, to avoid abrupt movements
    - Better combat detection
        - only assume that we're in combat when the player has taken a direct offensive action
        - how should this work with charge skills?

- DOWN THE LINE
    - lua syntax highlighter for lua code editing in-game
    - Weak Aura's support
        - be able to trigger a camera transition from a weak aura
